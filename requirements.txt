#NOTE: 
# 1. Some requirements are directly installed with "conda env create" 
#    they are mainatined in requirements_conda.txt file (its a hack, need to have only one line with requiremets in it!)
#
# 2.  pip install -r requirements would not work for this. 
#     use ./service/installreq.py instead
